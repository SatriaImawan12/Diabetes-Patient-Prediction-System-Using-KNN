# Diabetes Patient Prediction System Using KNN
A system for predicting diabetes in patients using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health features.

## Description
This project utilizes a dataset containing patient health information, such as glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and gender. The KNN algorithm is used to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.

## Dataset 
- [Dataset Diabetes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SAKIIy8AXW0s8IxumaNbf7XDj0-Bc0g7/view?usp=drive_link)

## Features
- **Import Library and Data Extraction**: Import library, load and display patient health data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling imbalance data.
- **Modeling**: Build a KNN model for prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Measure model performance using accuracy metrics.
